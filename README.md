<h1>Exercise Title: Forms</h1>

<h2>Exercise Description:</h2>
<p>In this exercise, I created a simple <code>HTML form</code> to familiarize myself with basic form elements. The form collects essential user information including <code>username</code>, <code>email</code>, and <code>password</code>. Each input field is appropriately labeled and marked as required, ensuring completeness of user input. Placeholder text is provided in each field to guide users on the expected format. A submission button is added to enable users to submit the form seamlessly. This exercise provides a foundational understanding of how to structure and utilize forms in HTML for data collection purposes.</p>
