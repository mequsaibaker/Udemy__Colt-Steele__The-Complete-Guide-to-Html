<h1>Exercise Title: Links and Images</h1>

<h2>Exercise Description:</h2>
<p>In this exercise, I explored the fundamental concepts of integrating links and images into HTML documents. Through structured practice, I gained a comprehensive understanding of how to incorporate hyperlinks to navigate between different web pages and embed images to enhance the visual appeal of a webpage. Starting with the basics, I learned how to create clickable links using the anchor <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> element, specifying the destination URL within the <code>href</code> attribute. Additionally, I grasped the significance of relative and absolute paths when linking to internal and external resources respectively. Building upon this foundation, I delved into incorporating images into HTML documents, employing the <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> element and specifying the image source using the <code>src</code> attribute. Understanding the importance of alternative text, I utilized the <code>alt</code> attribute to provide descriptive text for screen readers and in scenarios where the image fails to load. Throughout the exercise, I applied these concepts to construct a coherent webpage showcasing various links and images, reinforcing my proficiency in HTML markup.</p>
